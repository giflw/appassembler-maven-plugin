Generated Structure

* Directory Structure for Program

  If you have created a script based on the following configuration:

+--------------------------
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        ...
       <configuration>
          <programs>
            <program>
              <mainClass>com.mycompany.app.App</mainClass>
              <name>app</name>
            </program>
          </programs>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
+--------------------------

  The generated folder structure look like the following. There you have the <<<appassembler>>> folder
  which is defined by the <<<{{{./assemble-mojo.html#assembleDirectory}assembleDirectory}}>>> parameter 
  and the <<<bin>>> folder which is defined by <<<{{{./assemble-mojo.html#binFolder}binFolder}}>>> parameter. 
  The <<<repo>>> folder contains the dependencies of the current project. The name of the repository can be
  changed by the <<<{{{./assemble-mojo.html#repositoryName}repositoryName}}>>> parameter whereas the layout
  of the repository within can be influenced by using <<<{{{./assemble-mojo.html#repositoryLayout}repositoryLayout}}>>>.
