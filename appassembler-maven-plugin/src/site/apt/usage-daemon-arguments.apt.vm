Daemon Arguments

* Arguments for a Daemon

  If you like to define some kind of arguments which you like to serve to your daemon
  this can be achieved by using the following configuration:
  
+--------------------------
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    </plugins>
      <plugin>
        .
        .
        <configuration>
          <daemons>
            <daemon>
              <id>daemon-1</id>
              <mainClass>org.codehaus.mojo.appassembler.example.helloworld.HelloWorld</mainClass>
              <commandLineArguments>
                <commandLineArgument>argument_one</commandLineArgument>
                <commandLineArgument>argument_two</commandLineArgument>
              </commandLineArguments>
              <platforms>
                <platform>jsw</platform>
              </platforms>
            </daemon>
          </daemons>
        </configuration>
        ..
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
+--------------------------

  The configuration for the daemon call can be found in the <<<conf/wrapper.conf>>> file
  which contains the entries which will be supplied as the the command line arguments (excerpt).
  
+--------------------------
# Application parameters.  Add parameters as needed starting from 1
wrapper.app.parameter.1=org.codehaus.mojo.appassembler.example.helloworld.HelloWorld
wrapper.app.parameter.2=argument_one
wrapper.app.parameter.3=argument_two
